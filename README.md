# Python-from-0
This are the projects that I used to learn python from the ground up (from not knowing what a function was).

Each folder represents a step forward, each folder will have a Readme, with the following things:
1. What are the topics that the project is trying to internalize.
2. How many things and which things did I use AI, what did it teach me? what did I understand?
